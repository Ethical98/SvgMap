        It is the eight-largest state in India, covering an area of 162,975 km<span class="sup">2</span> (62,925 sq mi).As per the 2011

        is Visakhapatnam. Telugu, one of the classical languages of India, is the major and official language of Andhra Pradesh.
        The north-western portion of Andhra Pradesh was separated to form the new state of Telangana on 2 June 
        2014, and Hyderabad, the longtime capital of Andhra Pradesh, was transferred to Telangana as part of the 
        division. However, in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Hyderabad was to remain 
        the acting capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states for a period of time not exceeding ten years. 
        The new riverfront de facto capital, Amaravati, is under the jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region
        Development Authority (APCRDA).
        Andhra Pradesh has a coastline of 974 km (605 mi) – the second-longest coastline among the states of India, after 
        Gujarat – with jurisdiction over almost 15,000 km2 of territorial waters.The state is bordered by Telangana 
        in the north-west, Chhattisgarh and Odisha in the north-east, Karnataka in the west, Tamil Nadu in the south, and to
        the east lies the Bay of Bengal. The small enclave of Yanam, a district of Puducherry, lies to the south of Kakinada in 
        the Godavari delta on the eastern side of the state.</p>

          etc.

          Shorea talura, Shorea tumburgia, Psilotum nudum, etc. The diversity of fauna includes tigers, panthers,
          hyenas, black bucks, cheetals, sambars, sea turtles and a number of birds and reptiles. The estuaries of 
          the Godavari and Krishna Rivers support rich mangrove forests with fishing cats and otters as keystone

        <p>The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Summers last from March to June. 
          In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging 
          between 20 °C and 41 °C. July to September is the season for tropical rains. About one-third of the total rainfall is 
          brought by the northeast monsoon. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the 
          Bay of Bengal which, along with the northeast monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state.
          November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt 
          the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12 °C to 30 °C. Lambasingi in Visakhapatnam 
          district is the only place in South India which receives snowfall because of its location as at 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above 
          the sea level. It is also nicknamed as the "Kashmir of Andhra Pradesh" and the temperature ranges from 0 °C to 10 °C.</p>

                  Buddhism spread to Andhra Pradesh early in its history. The Krishna River valley was "a site of extraordinary Buddhist activity for almost a thousand years.The ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Krishna Valley, including Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda and Jaggayyapeta "can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.
                  The region played a central role in the development of Mahayana Buddhism, along with the Magadha-area in northeastern India. A.K. Warder holds that "the Mahāyāna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the Andhra country. According to Xing, "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajnaparamita probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India probably in the Andhra country, on the Krishna River.The Prajñāpāramitā Sutras belong to the earliest Mahayana Sutras.
